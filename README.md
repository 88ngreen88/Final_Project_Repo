## Background on Malaria

Malaria is a parasitic disease that is spread by infected mosquitoes. It is a major public health issue, particularly in developing countries with warm and humid climates, where transmission is more common. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria worldwide, with approximately 627,000 deaths, the majority of which were young children in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition to its devastating human toll, malaria also has significant economic and social impacts, particularly in affected countries. The disease has been estimated to cost the African continent over US$12 billion per year in lost productivity, treatment costs, and other expenses.

In domestic settings, malaria is an issue in some parts of the world where there are still high rates of the disease. In the United States, malaria was once a significant public health problem in the southern states, but its incidence has declined substantially since the 1940s, due to the use of effective control measures such as mosquito eradication programs and insecticides.

However, malaria continues to be a concern in some domestic settings, particularly among travelers to countries where malaria is endemic. In these cases, prevention measures such as taking antimalarial medication and using mosquito nets and repellents are recommended.
