## Background on Malaria

Malaria is a parasitic disease that is spread by infected mosquitoes. It is a major public health issue, particularly in developing countries with warm and humid climates, where transmission is more common. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria worldwide, with approximately 627,000 deaths, the majority of which were young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Looking at the barchart below, we can see that out all the regions in the world, Africa carries the largest malaria burden. In addition, this burden has only increased in the last few years:

In addition to its devastating human toll, malaria also has significant economic and social impacts, particularly in affected countries. The disease has been estimated to cost the African continent over US$12 billion per year in lost productivity, treatment costs, and other expenses. This is especially concerning given that Malaria funding through global and prive efforts has decreased over the last few years.

In the United States, malaria was once a significant public health problem in the southern states, but its incidence has declined substantially since the 1940s, due to the use of effective control measures such as mosquito eradication programs and insecticides. However, in recent years, there have been slight increased in the number of cases of malaria in the United States (see bar chart below). Most of these cases come from individuals contracting malaria while abroad in countries where malaria is endemic:

## Diagnosing Malaria with CNN

This project is a machine learning model that identifies malaria-infected cells in blood samples using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model was built using Python 3 and the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## My Data

The dataset used in this project is the Malaria Cell Images Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.

The images are provided in PNG format and are divided into two subdirectories: Parasitized and Uninfected. The Parasitized directory contains images of blood cells infected with malaria, while the Uninfected directory contains images of normal blood cells.
